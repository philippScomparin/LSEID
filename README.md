# Legal, Social, and Ethical Impact of Data Vocabulary (LSEID)

The Legal, Social, and Ethical Impact of Data Vocabulary includes all the vocabulary needed to describe datasets in terms of legal, social, and ethical impact. The vocabulary provides data publishers with the possibility to publish detailed metadata about the legal, social, and ethical impact of the data. Software Developers, Data Scientist or other individuals interested in the dataset can use the published metadata to analyze the possible impact of the data on their projects. They will be able to get a complete overview of the dataset, including the risks, security measures, and suggested as well as discouraged use for the data. With all this information they will be able to decide whether the data is suited for their project.
